## 📖 Summary

The health sector is one of the most emerging sectors where the use of technology is advancing highly day by day. With the development of technology tracking personal health, data collection and storage became easy. The data available helps healthcare professionals to develop and implement new healthcare strategies and also to provide personalized health care. The development of patient assessment models based on the available data is an emerging research field in the direction of pattern identification, feature extraction and classification.
“Virtual Patient Model Assessment”, an existing dataset from Kaggle was used for this project. This dataset includes parameters like clinical scores and parameters extracted from health monitoring devices or apps of elder people. This data focuses on elder patients above age 60 to assess their overall state of health, using medical parameters.
This report outlines how machine learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised can be used for analysing the patterns in patients and how they can be used for identifying adverse health conditions such as fall, fracture and depression, such that it can benefit in taking preventive measures and to provide proper health care. Seven different machine-learning algorithms are used here to create the model and to evaluate the performance. Four supervised learning models and 3 unsupervised models are used. Among the supervised models Random Forest model outperformed.

## 🎯 Conclusions

This paper mainly studied and discussed about how machine learning models can be used for predicting the overall health status of elder patients by identifying the risk factors associated with adverse physical health outcomes like falls, fractures and mental health issue like depression. For this task ‘Virtual patient model assessment’ dataset is used which includes details like medical parameters and other health-related data of 117 elder people. This research followed following procedures: Firstly, dataset has undergone some pre-processing like missing data handling, encoding data and normalizing. Then we trained four different machine learning algorithms to predict falls over one year and fractures in three-year period of time. Using the best formed model ‘Random Forest’, we determined risk factors of adverse health outcomes like fall and fracture. We were also able to determine a few crucial factors associated with depression issues in elderly. We used both types of machine learning techniques namely supervised and unsupervised and assessed how these two types are beneficial to create a model, and how they differ in their purpose. Among the supervised learning methods, the Random Forest model exhibited the best performance. For classifying the patients according to their risk variables, the unsupervised learning algorithms, such as K-means clustering, also demonstrated promising outcomes. The models offered interpretability in addition to prediction capability. We were able to determine which features the Random Forest model considered as most crucial for forecasting the results by using the feature importance it generated. By examining the results we obtained we could say that an individual's self-rated pain level, number of chronic diseases associated with them, their mental well-being and number of hospitalizations they had in one year period of time, all these features have significant impact on falls over one year period of time and the occurrence of fractures within a span of three years. In addition, alcohol consumption level also emerges as a noteworthy predictor for fractures. This means an increased discomforts can hinder physical activities and active mental functioning. From further analysis we determined individuals with higher gait speed, cognitive ability and mmse_scores are less prone to hospitalisations and have optimal psychological well-being. The development of focused therapies for older persons who are at higher risk can be aided by these findings.
